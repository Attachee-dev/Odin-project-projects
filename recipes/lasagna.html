<h2><strong>Cheesy Corndog Casserole</strong></h2>
<p>"This cheesy corndog casserole has the comforting flavors of a corndog with far less effort," says Senior Producer Nicole McLaughlin. "Hot dogs, cheese, and corn bread mix combine in an easy casserole."</p>
<h1><strong>Ingridients</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
    <li>3/4 cup chopped green onion</li>
    <li>8 hot dogs, cut into 1inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons mustard</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>
    <li>2(8 ounce) packages corn bread mix, such as jiffy</li>
    <li>8 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>STEPS</strong></h2>
<ol>

    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart rectangular baking dish.</li>
    <li>Combine zucchini and salt in a large bowl and toss to coat evenly. Transfer zucchini to a colander set in the sink. Let stand to drain excess moisture, 15 minutes. Transfer zucchini to a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out any remaining liquid. Use paper towels to wipe the large bowl dry.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.</li>
    <li>Whisk together eggs and pepper in the large bowl. Add zucchini, onion mixture, mozzarella, Cheddar, and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese; combine thoroughly. </li>
    <li>Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer.</li>
    <li>Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine panko and melted butter in a small bowl. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
    <li>Top casserole with breadcrumb mixture and bake until golden and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Garnish with chives.</li>
